            <p className="para"> When an entity (individual or organisation) invests the entire principal amount in any type of mutual fund in one go, it is known as a lumpsum investment. High Net Worth Individuals (HNIs) or big-shot investors who have a substantial sum of money to invest or individuals with long-term investment ambitions sometimes adopt the lumpsum investment approach. However, to make a lumpsum investment in mutual funds, you must first do a thorough examination of the present market conditions.</p>

            <p className="para mb-2">
              A lumpsum calculator works on a compound interest formula for computing the estimated investment returns wherein one variable represents the number of times the levied interest rate is compounded annually.
            </p>
            <p className="para mb-4"><b>A = P (1 + r/n) ^ nt</b></p>

            </ul>
            <p className="para mb-4">For better understanding letâ€™s go through an example</p>
            <p className="para mb-4">
              Ravi invests INR 15 lakh as a lumpsum investment in a mutual fund scheme with average returns rate of 12 percent per annum and compounds in the interval of six months for the term of 5 years.
            </p>
            <p className="para mb-4">The case-specific estimated returns would be</p>
            <p className="para mb-4">
              <b>A = 15,00,000 (1 + 12/2) ^ 2/5</b>
            </p>
            <p className="para mb-4">
              This accounts to be a complex equation that would be difficult to grasp for a major percentage of novice investors. Thatâ€™s exactly where a lumpsum calculator will come into play to compute the values in a fraction of a second.

            <p className="para mb-4">
